# Base URL for the backend API. If not set, the app falls back to "/api" which works
# with Create React App proxy when backend runs on localhost:8000.
# Example for local development:
# REACT_APP_BACKEND_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
REACT_APP_BACKEND_API_URL=

# Note: Do NOT put your OpenAI key in the frontend. The frontend does not use it.
# The backend calls OpenAI securely using its own OPENAI_API_KEY.
